# CLIMADA Networks - Globally consistent CI failure cascades &amp; basic service losses

This is a short teaser to give an insight into the Critical Infrastructure &amp; Basic Service Loss Module developed within the [CLIMADA](https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html) Environment -  a probabilistic, globally consistent and spatially explicit natural hazard risk calculation engine - also on [GitHub](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python).

Current code for the Critical infrastructure & basic service loss networks can be found on the respective [github branch](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_petals/tree/feature/networks).

This repository contains a end-to-end simulation of the workflow, from the hazard (a Tropical Cyclone), over multiple CI failure cascades (power, roads, service facilities), to an examplary basic service end point (healthcare access, climada_CI_networks.pdf)
As well as the code architecture overview (Network Worklfow.pdf)
